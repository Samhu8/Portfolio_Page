<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hugo Samayoa. I am 36 years old. I live in Los Angeles, CA. I have worked the majority of my life in call centers.
  For the past year, I discovered software development and have been fascinated by what you can do and build with this skill.
  I started teaching myself by watching tutorials. After a while. I wanted real training from professionals.
  This is when I joined the coding bootcamp Coding Dojo and finished my program while holding a full time job.
</p>

<p>While I learned a lot in Coding Dojo, I understand that the key to success is practice, practice, practice.
  While I could continue to work on random projects which I do plan on doing, I also appreciate the importance of structure and having
  a roadmap. This is why I began another program for Software Development with Udemy. I like the practice and honestly I just really enjoy
  learning code. I want to master this craft and begin a new career within Software Development.
</p>

<p>I am excited and eager to see what opportunities this new skill will provide me. I want to make software development the
  career I choose moving and will work very hard for any potential employer that gives me an opportunity.
