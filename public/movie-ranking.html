<h1>The Best Movies According to Hugo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Face Off</h3>
<p>
One of my favorite actors is Nicholas Cage and I think this is one of his best movies hands down.
It's got action and a good story plot. I love it!

<h3>I Love You, Man</h3>
<p>
This is my favorite comedy feel good movie.
It's really funny and it's so enjoyable that I can put it on and watch it over and over again.

<h3>Avengers: End Game</h3>
<p>
This movie was the colmination of several differnt movies combined into one final chapter.
I thought it was really creative and nicely done.
I haven't seen anything like that before.
It gave me goosebumps at the end.
